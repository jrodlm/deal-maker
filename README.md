## Description
**Deal Maker** is a Django CRUD application that helps aspiring business buyers track acquisition opportunities. It lets users log deal details, view financial metrics, and understand key valuation terms like SDE, asking price, and current revenue.

### Why I Built It
I created Deal Maker to support my own acquisition journey â€” a space to organize, evaluate, and reflect on business-for-sale listings with clarity and intention.
